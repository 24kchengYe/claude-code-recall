# Recall — Never Lose a Claude Code Conversation Again

> **Cross-project session manager with category organization, version history, and anti-compaction backup — without sacrificing Claude Code's security model.**

## Why Recall?

There are two extremes in AI coding assistants today:

**OpenClaw** gives you full-computer autonomy — persistent memory across days, browser automation, 700+ skills, 24/7 background agents. But it runs with **elevated system permissions, no sandbox, and autonomous command execution**. Cisco's AI security team found community skills performing [data exfiltration without user awareness](https://www.unite.ai/openclaw-vs-claude-code-remote-control-agents/). As one developer put it: *"OpenClaw is basically Claude Code without the corporate safety guardrails."*

**Claude Code** takes the opposite approach — sandboxed execution, human approval for critical operations, project-scoped isolation. Secure by design. But this means **conversations are locked to individual project directories**. You can't see, search, or resume sessions from other projects. Every project is an island.

**Recall bridges this gap.** It adds cross-project session management, persistent organization, and long-term memory — all while keeping Claude Code's permission model and security guarantees intact. No elevated permissions, no background processes, no autonomous execution. Just a lightweight index layer on top of Claude Code's native storage.

## The Problem Recall Solves

Claude Code stores conversation history **per project directory** (`~/.claude/projects/<path>/`). This means:

- Sessions from **Project A are invisible** when you're working in **Project B**
- Built-in `/resume` only shows sessions from the **current** directory
- No way to organize conversations by topic — they're locked to whichever folder you opened
- No cross-project knowledge transfer between related conversations
- No central place to find "that conversation from last week"

This is true across VS Code, JetBrains, Cursor, Windsurf, and terminal CLI.

## What Recall Does

Recall creates a **centralized session index** — a management layer that maps to original session files while keeping backup copies organized by user-defined categories.

```
~/claude-sessions/                ← Central directory (configurable)
├── _config.json                  ← Categories & settings
├── 论文/
│   ├── BSAS论文修改_meta.json    ← Metadata + mapping to original
│   └── BSAS论文修改.jsonl        ← Full session backup
├── 代码/
│   ├── WebApp重构_meta.json
│   └── WebApp重构.jsonl
└── 学习/
```

**Key design**: Recall is a **read-mostly index layer**, not a replacement for Claude Code's native storage. It preserves Claude Code's security model — no elevated permissions, no background processes, no autonomous execution.

| `/recall list` | List all saved sessions in a table |
| `/recall list search <keyword>` | Search sessions by name, summary, or tags |

| `/recall manage` | Manage categories (add, remove, view stats) |

## Core Features

### Save & Organize
Save any conversation to a central location with a custom name and category. Default categories: 学习, 生活, 代码, 算法, 论文, 工作, 杂项 — fully customizable.

**Auto-update**: Save a session once, then `/recall save` again anytime for a fresh snapshot — no re-selection needed. Recall detects the existing backup by session ID and silently updates it.

**Filesystem-first detection**: Recall identifies the current session by filesystem modification time, not `sessions-index.json` (which can be stale). This ensures accurate detection even when Claude Code hasn't updated its own index.

### Cross-Project Context Loading (`/recall load`)
The killer feature. Load content from a past conversation into your **current** session as reference context. Two modes:
- **Brief**: User questions + assistant text answers only
- **Detailed**: Includes tool usage summaries (which files were edited, what commands ran)

This enables cross-project knowledge transfer — discuss an algorithm in Project A, then load that context while working in Project B. Like OpenClaw's persistent memory, but on-demand and without background token consumption.

### Interactive Browse (`/recall browse`)
Visual, clickable hierarchical navigation designed for hundreds of sessions:
1. **Layer 1**: Category overview (with session counts)
2. **Layer 2**: Session list within a category (paginated, 3 per page)
3. **Layer 3**: Session detail + executable actions (load, resume, rename, move)

### Version History & Anti-Compaction (`/recall history`)
The central directory is a git repository. Every `/recall save` auto-commits a snapshot, giving you full version history:
- **View history**: See every save point with timestamp and message count
- **Compare versions**: See how a conversation grew between two saves
- **Rollback**: Restore any historical version — the current version is never lost
- **Anti-compaction**: Claude Code compresses long conversations, permanently losing early messages. Frequent `/recall save` captures the full conversation before compaction happens. If compaction truncates your session, rollback to a pre-compaction snapshot to recover the complete history.

### Search & Statistics
- **Search**: Find sessions by keyword across name, summary, first prompt, and tags
- **Recent**: Quick view of your N most recently modified sessions
- **Stats**: Overview of total sessions, messages, per-category counts, most active category, largest session

### Resume from Anywhere
Select a session from any project, and Recall handles the rest:

- **Same project**: Shows the `claude --resume` command directly
- **Different project**: Opens a **new VSCode window** or **new terminal** at the target project, with the resume command ready to paste
- **Original deleted**: Restores from backup first, then provides the resume command

No more hunting through directories to find where a conversation lives.

### Bidirectional Rename
When you rename a session in Recall, it updates **both** the central index and the original project's `sessions-index.json`. No desync between what Recall shows and what `/resume` shows.

## Installation

### From Skills CLI (Recommended)

```bash
npx skills add 24kchengYe/claude-code-recall
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
# macOS / Linux
git clone https://github.com/24kchengYe/claude-code-recall.git ~/.claude/skills/recall

# Windows
git clone https://github.com/24kchengYe/claude-code-recall.git %USERPROFILE%\.claude\skills\recall
```

## Requirements

- Claude Code (VS Code, JetBrains, Cursor, Windsurf, or terminal CLI)
- Python 3.8+ (for the helper script that parses `.jsonl` session files)
- Git (for version history — auto-initialized on first save)

## Configuration

On first `/recall save`, Recall initializes:
- **Storage path**: Default `~/claude-sessions/` — you'll be prompted to confirm or customize
- **Categories**: Default set provided, fully customizable via `/recall manage`

All settings stored in `<basePath>/_config.json`.

## How Claude Code Stores Sessions (Background)

For those curious about the internals:

- Each project maps to a directory: `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/`
- Sessions are stored as `.jsonl` files (one JSON object per line)
- A `sessions-index.json` per project tracks session metadata (but is often stale — not all sessions are indexed)
- Message types include: `user`, `assistant`, `system`, `progress`, and more
- Context compression creates `compact_boundary` markers in long sessions

Recall reads these native files and builds an index on top of them — it doesn't replace Claude Code's storage, just adds a cross-project management layer. When `sessions-index.json` is stale, Recall falls back to filesystem modification times for reliable session detection.
